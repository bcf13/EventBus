EVENT BUS README

--------------------------------------- Files: ---------------------------------------------

Main.cpp: 
	-Contains series of functions and example usage of EventBus class
	-Support of arbitrary function signatures (including string arguments) is demonstrated
	-Cancellation behavior is demonstrated
	-Error handling is demonstrated (argument count mismatch, invocation of unregistered events)

EventBus.cpp:
	-Essentially empty (only constructor/destructor)

EventBus.hpp:
	-Contains implementation of 'Add' and 'Invoke'
	-Both are templatized to support arbitrary functions and parameters
	-Main data structure is map between event-strings and sets of (pointers to base classes of) functions
	-Base Class functions are cast to their derived signatures when invoked or statically analyzed
	-List of event-strings that have been canceled is maintained
	-Cancellation: Functions with return-type 'cancelReturnT' cancel subsequent functions sharing event name 

Utilities.h:
	-Defines 'cancelReturnT' type
	-Contains functions to statically analyze std::function<T> instances
	-Contains Function and (derived) SpecificFunction classes 

--------------------------------------- Assumptions: ------------------------------------------
	
	-Assumes cancellation can be indicated via the signature of a function (see above)
	-Assumes client code does not rely on return values (example functions are mostly void-return type)
	-Does not explicitly handle Adding events after invocation occurs
	-Assumes support of lambdas or potentially other callable-functions is not required 


--------------------------------------- Other Notes: ------------------------------------------
	
	-Considered applying pimpl idiom to hide implementation from header, but was difficult with lots of
	templatized functions 
	-Considered maintaining map between strings and sets of indices into other structure to avoid 
	duplicating storage of function pointers, but implementation was complex/awkward
	-Notice that 'Invoke' perfect forwards its arguments to the underlying function when possible
